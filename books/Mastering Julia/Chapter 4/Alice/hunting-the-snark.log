There was also a Beaver, that paced on the deck,
He could only kill Beavers. The Bellman looked scared,
There was only one Beaver on board;
The Beaver, who happened to hear the remark,
The Beaver's best course was, no doubt, to procure
The Beaver kept looking the opposite way,
But the Beaver went on making lace, and displayed
The Beaver went simply galumphing about,
THE BEAVER'S LESSON
But the very same plan to the Beaver occurred:
The Beaver turned pale to the tip of its tail,
The Beaver had counted with scrupulous care,
The Beaver brought paper,portfolio, pens,
Which the Beaver could well understand.
He considered the Beaver his friend.
While the Beaver confessed, with affectionate looks
Such friends, as the Beaver and Butcher became,
That the Beaver's lace-making was wrong,
And the Beaver, excited at last,
'Just the place for a Snark!' the Bellman cried,
And had often (the Bellman said) saved them from wreck,
(So the Bellman would often remark)
And it drove the poor Bellman half-mad--
The good Bellman engaged him at once.
He could only kill Beavers. The Bellman looked scared,
But the Bellman declared that would never agree

And the Bellman cried 'Silence! Not even a shriek!'
'Skip all that!' cried the Bellman in haste.
'Oh, skip your dear uncle!' the Bellman exclaimed,
('That's exactly the method,' the Bellman bold
The Bellman indignantly said.
The Bellman looked uffish, and wrinkled his brow.
''Tis a pitiful tale,' said the Bellman, whose face
Which the Bellman declared was all 'stuff.'
And the Bellman, sagaciously nodding his head,
'Be a man!' said the Bellman in wrath, as he heard
'As the Bellman would tell you,' he added with pride,
They returned hand-in-hand, and the Bellman, unmanned
Which the Bellman rang close at his ear.
And the Bellman remarked 'It is just as I feared!'
The Bellman exclaimed in a fright.
'There is Thingumbob shouting!' the Bellman said,
